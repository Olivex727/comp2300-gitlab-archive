### comment: 
Code submitted as a part of Assignment 1 was used in this assignment for both display and pattern generation purposes (i.e. displaying images to the Microbit LED board). This work is of my own despite being used in a previous COMP2300 assessment.
The following files were used:
- game_of_life.S (Minor Mods. - where certain data is read)
- display.S (Some Mods. - using SysTick interrupts for delays)
- reader.S (Heavy Mods. - only sections of code were recycled to read arrays)
All files are found in the given repository URL.
